So, comparing the last two graphics, we can see that the pattern is quite similar in both price and number of properties in the different cities. 

From a **consumer perspective**, a motivation to book an Airbnb would be to find a city where there is lots of variety for a low price, which in this case would be in Brooklyn.

According to the graph, Manhattan and Staten Island are the cities where hosts offer more entire home/apt than any other room type. On the other hand, Brooklyn and Queens and Bronx offer more private rooms. 

So, as a customer, if you want to go somewhere staying in an entire home, you should look for Airbnbs in Manhattan. Anyways, if you would rather stay in a private room **because of the low cost**, then you should go to Brooklyn.
