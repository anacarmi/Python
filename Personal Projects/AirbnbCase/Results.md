The price of booking an Airbnb is higher in Manhattan than any other city.

So, comparing the last two graphics, we can see that the pattern is quite similar in both price and number of properties in the different cities. 

From a **customer's perspective**, a motivation to book an Airbnb would be to find a city where there is lots of variety for a low price, which in this case would be in Brooklyn.


### Room Type information for Customer

According to the graphs, Manhattan and Staten Island are the cities where hosts offer more entire home/apt than any other room type. On the other hand, Brooklyn and Queens and Bronx offer more private rooms.  

So, as a customer, if you want to go somewhere staying in an entire home, you should look for Airbnbs in Manhattan, even though they are expensive. Anyways, if you would rather stay in a private room **because of the low cost**, then you should go to Brooklyn.

Looking at Staten Island, we can conclude that it would'nt be an option to look for any type of Airbnb in that city, because of the **low diversity and the high price** of being there.

### Insights for Hosts

Based on the data, the minimum revenue that hosts obtain are the following:

So, as a possible host, you could decide **in which city to list your place for the service**. In this case, Manhattan is the best option, followed by Brooklyn and Queens. 


### Final Comments

Because of the _Airbnb's exponential growth_, there is a lot of opportunity for hosts -to obtain profits- and clients -to have the Aribnb experience-. 

From **the customer's point of view**, it would be better to look for Airbnbs in Brooklyn because of the _low price_ and the _variety_ of rooms available. Since every year there is more and more properties in the market, it would be easier to find one with the client requierements.

On the other hand, for **possible hosts** would be better to stablish a location in Manhattan, since there is a _high revenue_ and possible profit, compared to the others cities.
